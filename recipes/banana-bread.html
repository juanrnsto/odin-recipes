    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
            <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
            <li>Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
            <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
            <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>

            <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
